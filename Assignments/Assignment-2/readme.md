## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to showcase the progress and completion of Assignment 2 for the SU2 GSOC program. This includes code, documentation, and any other relevant files.

## Set up a test case from scratch
- Generate a 2D mesh for an axisymmetric, steady-state, turbulent jet case (gmsh)
- Setup the configuration file
- Run the simulation
- Extract results (e.g. paraview)

### Deliverables:
#### Small report:
   - motivation for set-up
   - configuration options
   - convergence history
   - comparison with experimental values
